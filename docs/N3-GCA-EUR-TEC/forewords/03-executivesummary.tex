This document describes the architecture and stratregy used to build the N3 demos website.
It's aimed at developpers and NumeriCube fellows in order to understand clearly our methodology of work.

Basically, we used:
\begin{description}
\item[Django] the Python framework with batteries included. Mostly used for API.
\item[Vue.js] as the main frontend framework (JS-based)
\item[Docker] for container management
\item[Docker Swarm] for container orchestration
\end{description}
